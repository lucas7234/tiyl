# TIYL

## Introducing
__TIYL(This Is Your Life)__ is a programming language. 
There are some differences and features of TIYL:

* People who don't know programming can realize it easily.
* Made programs by our(by human) languages.
* Little difficult for people who already know other programming language.

## Syntax
Visit our wiki to see some effective syntaxes.

## Developing Environment
TIYL is an interpreter language, so you need to download interpreter and run it and type commands in one line. We are developing IDLE for TIYL, **and we do not support many commands in one line yet in interpreter.**

### How to use interpreter
Run interpreter and you will see:
```>>> ```
Enter your command like:
```>>> apple is 5
   >>> there is (apple)s.```

and you will see:
```>>> apple is 5
   >>> there is (apple)s.
   there is 5 apples.
   >>>
```
